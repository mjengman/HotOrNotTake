# üÜò URGENT: OpenAI API Key Not Working on React Native Device Builds - Need Help!

## üö® TECHNICAL HELP REQUEST FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**To**: ChatGPT-5, Grok, Gemini, Claude, and any other AI that can help!
**From**: Frustrated developers who've been battling this for days
**Subject**: React Native + Expo + EAS + OpenAI API = Works in emulator, fails on device

**WE NEED YOUR BRAIN POWER TO SOLVE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL! üß†‚ö°**

---

## üî• THE PROBLEM THAT'S DRIVING US INSANE

We have a React Native app built with Expo that uses OpenAI API for content moderation. Here's what's happening:

### ‚úÖ **Works Perfect In Development**
- Expo development client: ALL OpenAI API calls succeed
- `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` returns correct API key
- AI moderation blocks inappropriate content flawlessly
- Category validation works perfectly
- Debug logs show API key is present and valid

### üî¥ **COMPLETELY FAILS ON DEVICE**  
- EAS production builds: OpenAI API calls fail silently
- Content moderation bypassed - inappropriate content gets through
- Category validation fails with generic "doesn't fit this category" errors
- Debug logs show API key might be missing or malformed

**THIS IS BLOCKING OUR LAUNCH!** üò≠

## üìã EXACT CONFIGURATION (Please Review!)

### EAS Secret Setup
```bash
$ eas env:list
ID          92add4c2-5453-4298-ab97-8150549ab652
Name        OPENAI_API_KEY
Scope       project  
Type        STRING
Updated at  Aug 09 04:33:13
```

### eas.json Configuration  
```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Code Implementation
```typescript
const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY;

// Debug logging we added
console.log('üîê OpenAI Debug Info:');
console.log('  Key present?', !!OPENAI_API_KEY);
console.log('  Key preview:', String(OPENAI_API_KEY || '').slice(0, 7) + '‚Ä¶');
console.log('  Environment:', __DEV__ ? 'DEVELOPMENT' : 'PRODUCTION');

export const moderateUserTake = async (takeText: string) => {
  if (!OPENAI_API_KEY) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è No OpenAI API key - auto-approving take');
    return { approved: true }; // This happens on device!
  }
  
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: moderationPrompt }],
      max_tokens: 50,
      temperature: 0.1,
    }),
  });
  // ... rest of implementation
};
```

## üö® WHAT WE'VE TRIED (And Still Doesn't Work!)

### ‚úÖ **Verified EAS Secret**
- Secret exists with correct name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Secret contains valid OpenAI API key (works in Postman)
- Secret scope is set to `project`

### ‚úÖ **Confirmed eas.json Mapping**  
- Mapping: `"EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY"`
- Same mapping in both preview and production profiles
- No typos in environment variable names

### ‚úÖ **Added Debug Logging**
```typescript
// This shows API key is missing on device builds!
console.log('üîê API Key present?', !!process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY);
```

### ‚úÖ **Fresh Builds After Changes**
- Built fresh EAS build after every secret change
- Cleared all caches
- Installed completely new APK on device
- Still no API key access on device!

### ‚úÖ **Tested Different Approaches**
- Tried `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` (without EXPO_PUBLIC prefix)
- Tried different secret names
- Tried hardcoding API key temporarily (worked, but security risk)
- Tried moving API calls to different services

---

## ü§î CURRENT THEORIES (Need Your Input!)

### Theory 1: Environment Variable Access Issue
- Maybe `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` doesn't work the same way on device?
- Could there be a different way to access EAS secrets in production builds?

### Theory 2: Expo/EAS Build Process Problem
- Maybe EAS builds aren't properly injecting environment variables?
- Could there be a build configuration we're missing?

### Theory 3: React Native Bundle Issue  
- Maybe the environment variables get stripped during the bundling process?
- Could metro bundler be removing them?

### Theory 4: Network/Security Issue
- Maybe device builds have different network stack?
- Could there be SSL/TLS certificate issues with OpenAI API on device?

---

## üÜò WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU

**PLEASE HELP US FIGURE OUT:**

1. **Is our EAS configuration correct?** What are we missing?

2. **Are there alternative ways to access environment variables** in React Native device builds?

3. **Should we use a different approach** for storing/accessing API keys in production?

4. **Are there known issues** with Expo + EAS + OpenAI API integration?

5. **What debugging steps** should we try next to isolate the root cause?

## üöÄ URGENCY LEVEL: MAXIMUM

We're literally ready to launch to Google Play Store but this ONE issue is blocking us. Our users are waiting, our marketing is ready, everything else works perfectly - we just need the AI features to work on actual devices!

**PLEASE, ANY AI THAT READS THIS: HELP US! üôè**

What are we missing? What should we try next? Is there a secret Expo/React Native configuration we don't know about?

---

**Last Updated**: August 2025  
**Status**: üî¥ STILL BROKEN - NEED HELP!  
**Next Step**: Asking every AI assistant we can find! 

## ü§ñ AI ASSISTANTS: PLEASE REPLY WITH YOUR THEORIES!

### 1. **EAS Secret Naming Mismatch**
```bash
# What we had in EAS Console:
Secret Name: OPENAI_API_KEY

# What our eas.json was trying to map:
"EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY"  ‚úÖ This was correct!

# What our code was accessing:
process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY  ‚úÖ This was also correct!
```

**Verdict**: Our configuration was actually correct, but there was a deeper issue...

### 2. **Build-Time vs Runtime Environment Variables**
The critical insight from ChatGPT:

> **Environment variables in EAS builds are injected at BUILD TIME, not runtime.**

This means:
- ‚úÖ **Development**: Expo can access environment variables dynamically
- ‚ùå **Device Builds**: Environment variables are baked into the build and can't be changed without rebuilding
- üîÑ **Solution**: Any EAS secret changes require a complete rebuild to take effect

### 3. **Silent Failure Pattern**
Our error handling was too graceful:
```typescript
if (!OPENAI_API_KEY) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è No OpenAI API key - auto-approving take');
  return { approved: true }; // This masked the real problem!
}
```

On device, the API key was missing, so everything got auto-approved without any indication of failure.

---

## üîß The Solution That Worked

### Step 1: Verify EAS Secret Configuration
```bash
# Check current secrets
eas secret:list
# or newer command:
eas env:list

# Ensure the secret exists with correct name
ID          92add4c2-5453-4298-ab97-8150549ab652
Name        OPENAI_API_KEY ‚úÖ
Scope       project
Type        STRING
```

### Step 2: Confirm eas.json Mapping
```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY" // ‚úÖ Correct mapping
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY" // ‚úÖ Correct mapping
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Add Debug Logging
Following ChatGPT's recommendation:
```typescript
// Debug logging for device troubleshooting
console.log('üîê OpenAI Debug Info:');
console.log('  Key present?', !!OPENAI_API_KEY);
console.log('  Key preview:', String(OPENAI_API_KEY || '').slice(0, 7) + '‚Ä¶');
console.log('  Environment:', __DEV__ ? 'DEVELOPMENT' : 'PRODUCTION');
```

### Step 4: REBUILD After Any EAS Changes
This was the crucial step we initially missed:
```bash
# After any EAS secret changes, you MUST rebuild
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Environment variables are baked in at build time
# Installing an old build will never see new environment variables
```

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Development Environment Test
```typescript
// In your app startup
const testAPIConnection = async () => {
  console.log('üîê API Key Debug:');
  console.log('Present:', !!process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY);
  console.log('Preview:', process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY?.slice(0, 7));
  
  // Test with a simple API call
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/models', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY}` }
    });
    console.log('üü¢ OpenAI API Test:', response.ok ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('üî¥ OpenAI API Test: ERROR', error.message);
  }
};
```

### Device Testing Checklist
- [ ] Install fresh build (not cached APK)
- [ ] Check debug logs for API key presence
- [ ] Test AI moderation with inappropriate content
- [ ] Verify category validation with mismatched submissions
- [ ] Monitor for silent failures in production logs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

ChatGPT provided this important warning:

> **Since this exposes a real OpenAI key in a client app, anyone with the APK can extract it.**

### Short-term (Launch) ‚úÖ
- Accept the security risk for MVP launch
- Monitor API usage closely
- Set spending limits on OpenAI account

### Long-term (Post-Launch) üîí
- Move AI processing to Cloud Functions
- Keep API keys server-side
- Client calls your API, not OpenAI directly

Example architecture:
```
Mobile App ‚Üí Your Cloud Function ‚Üí OpenAI API
           ‚Üë (Your API with authentication)
```

---

## üöÄ Our Final Working Configuration

### EAS Secret
```bash
Secret Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: sk-... (your actual OpenAI API key)
```

### eas.json
```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY": "$OPENAI_API_KEY"  
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Code Implementation
```typescript
const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY;

// Debug logging (remove in production)
console.log('üîê API Key present?', !!OPENAI_API_KEY);
console.log('üîê Key preview:', String(OPENAI_API_KEY || '').slice(0, 7) + '‚Ä¶');

export const moderateUserTake = async (takeText: string) => {
  if (!OPENAI_API_KEY) {
    // Don't auto-approve in production - throw error instead
    throw new Error('OpenAI API key not configured');
  }
  
  // ... rest of implementation
};
```

## üìö Key Learnings

### 1. **Environment Variables Are Build-Time, Not Runtime**
The biggest insight: EAS builds bake environment variables into the binary. You can't change them without rebuilding.

### 2. **Development vs Production Parity**
What works in `expo start` doesn't guarantee it works in `eas build`. Always test on actual device builds.

### 3. **Graceful Error Handling Can Mask Critical Issues**
Our "default to approval" error handling hid the fact that API calls were failing entirely.

### 4. **Debug Logging Is Essential for Device Issues**
Without device logs, diagnosing environment variable issues is nearly impossible.

### 5. **Naming Consistency Matters**
Even though our naming was correct, the confusion around secret names vs environment variable names caused debugging delays.

---

## üîÑ Troubleshooting Workflow

If you encounter similar issues:

### 1. **Verify the Chain**
```bash
# Check EAS secret exists
eas env:list

# Check eas.json mapping
grep -A 10 '"env"' eas.json

# Check code access
grep -r "process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY" src/
```

### 2. **Add Debug Logging**
```typescript
console.log('üîë All env vars:', Object.keys(process.env));
console.log('üîë OpenAI key:', process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY ? 'PRESENT' : 'MISSING');
```

### 3. **Test API Connection**
```typescript
// Simple test call
const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/models', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY}` }
});
console.log('API Status:', response.status);
```

### 4. **Fresh Build & Test**
- Never trust cached builds when debugging environment variables
- Always build fresh after EAS secret changes
- Test on physical device, not just emulator
