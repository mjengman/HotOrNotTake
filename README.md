# 🔥 Hot or Not Takes

**🎉 NOW LIVE IN PRODUCTION! 🎉**

A React Native app for swiping judgment on controversial, funny, or outrageous hot takes — from food opinions to life philosophy. Players swipe **HOT** if they agree with the take, or **NOT** if they think it's nonsense. Users can also submit their own takes to be judged by the world.
