# ü§ñ AI Content Generation System - Detailed Breakdown

## Overview
Our app uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to generate controversial "hot takes" that feel authentic and human-written. The system is designed to create unique, engaging content that drives user interaction while maintaining quality and avoiding harmful content.

## üéØ Core Approach

### Model Configuration
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective, fast, good quality)
- **Max Tokens**: 60 (keeps takes short and punchy)
- **Temperature**: 0.9 + (attempt * 0.1) - starts creative, gets more creative with retries
- **Presence Penalty**: 0.8 - strongly encourages unique ideas
- **Frequency Penalty**: 0.5 - reduces repetition within response
- **Top-P**: 0.9 - nucleus sampling for variety

### Retry Logic
- **Max Retries**: 3 attempts per generation
- **Adaptive Creativity**: Each retry increases temperature by 0.1
- **Fresh Prompts**: Each attempt gets a new category-specific prompt
- **Variety Factors**: Random "spice" added to each attempt

## üìù Prompt Engineering Deep Dive

### System Prompt Structure

```
You are a creative content generator for a "Hot or Not Takes" app where users vote on controversial opinions.

CRITICAL: Generate completely original content. Avoid generic or common hot takes.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Generate ONE controversial "hot take" that sounds like a real person wrote it
- Keep it SHORT and PUNCHY - between 15-100 characters maximum
- Make it opinion-based, not factual claims
- Avoid offensive, discriminatory, or harmful content
- Use conversational, confident tone like you're stating your opinion
- BE CONCISE - think casual conversation, not formal writing
- NO em-dashes (‚Äî) - use regular dashes (-) or commas instead
- NO questions like "Hot or not?" - just state the opinion directly
- Sound human and natural - like something someone would actually say
- [VARIETY_FACTOR - random spice]

CATEGORY: [category]
SPECIFIC FOCUS: [category-specific prompt]

Examples of natural, human-sounding takes:
- "Pineapple belongs on pizza and I'll die on this hill"
- "Small talk is just socially acceptable interrogation" 
- "Cats are better roommates than most humans"
- "Cereal with warm milk is actually superior"
- "Airport food is overpriced theater food"

Return ONLY the hot take text, nothing else.
```

### Dynamic Elements

#### 1. **Variety Factors** (Random)
- "Be specific and avoid generic statements"
- "Focus on a niche aspect most people wouldn't think of"
- "Challenge a widely accepted belief"
- "Take an unexpected angle on a common topic"
- "Be bold and make people think twice"

#### 2. **Category-Specific Prompts** (Random per category)

**Food Category Examples:**
- "Generate a controversial opinion about a specific food combination"
- "Create a hot take about cooking methods, kitchen habits, or food culture"
- "Make a bold statement about popular restaurants, food trends, or dining experiences"

**Technology Category Examples:**
- "Generate a controversial opinion about a popular app, social media platform, or tech company"
- "Create a hot take about smartphone features, tech trends, or digital habits"
- "Make a bold statement about AI, automation, or the future of technology"

**Work Category Examples:**
- "Generate a controversial opinion about remote work, office culture, or work-life balance"
- "Create a hot take about job interviews, career advice, or workplace dynamics"
- "Make a bold statement about specific professions, industries, or business practices"

*(13 categories total, each with 5 specific prompts)*

## üîç Quality Control System

### 1. **Content Filtering**
- **Unwanted Phrases Detection**: Filters out AI-sounding language
  - "hot or not", "what do you think", "thoughts?"
  - "controversial opinion:", "hot take:", "unpopular opinion:"
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes markdown, normalizes quotes, trims whitespace

### 2. **Uniqueness Validation**
- **Exact Match Check**: Prevents duplicate takes
- **Similarity Analysis**: 60%+ word overlap triggers rejection
- **Category-Specific**: Only compares within same category
- **Meaningful Words**: Filters out words <4 characters for comparison

### 3. **Quality Scoring**
```javascript
const confidence = Math.min(0.95, Math.max(0.4, 
  (finalText.length / 150) * 0.6 +           // Length factor
  (finalText.includes('!') ? 0.1 : 0) +      // Excitement bonus
  (finalText.split(' ').length > 6 ? 0.2 : 0) + // Complexity bonus
  (attempt === 1 ? 0.1 : 0)                  // First attempt bonus
));
```

## üìä Current Performance

### Success Metrics
- **Character Range**: 15-100 characters (typically 40-80)
- **Success Rate**: ~85% on first attempt, 95%+ within 3 attempts
- **Uniqueness**: 100% unique content (duplicates rejected)
- **Categories**: 13 supported categories with tailored prompts

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Rate Limiting
- **Delay Between Generations**: 500-800ms to avoid API limits
- **Batch Processing**: Generates multiple takes efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and retries

### Data Storage
- **AI Flag**: `isAIGenerated: true` to distinguish from user content
- **Metadata**: Category, confidence score, generation timestamp
- **Auto-Approval**: AI takes bypass manual moderation

### Integration Points
- **Manual Trigger**: Pull-to-refresh generates 20 takes for current category
- **Background Seeding**: Maintains minimum 5 takes per category
- **Real-time**: New takes appear immediately in feed
